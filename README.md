# Atm_Booth

This Java-based ATM project simulates the core functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine. The project includes the following features:

PIN Verification: Users must enter a correct PIN (3456) to access the ATM menu. Incorrect PIN entries prompt the user to re-enter the PIN.

Menu Options:

Check Balance: Displays the current account balance.
Withdraw Money: Allows the user to withdraw a specified amount if the balance is sufficient. It updates and displays the new balance after the transaction.
Deposit Money: Enables the user to deposit a specified amount into the account. The new balance is displayed after the deposit.
Exit: Returns the user to the PIN entry screen.
Error Handling: The system prompts the user for valid inputs and handles insufficient balance situations gracefully.

This project demonstrates basic concepts in Java such as classes, methods, user input handling, and conditional statements, providing a foundational understanding of how real-world ATM systems operate.
